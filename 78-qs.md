23. What is the difference between a Technical Design Document and a Functional Design Document?
    *Hint:* FDD is created by the business/functional team, outlining “what” the system must do; TDD is created by developers, outlining “how” to implement it (diagrams, database changes, code flow).

24. Do you know UML diagrams?
    *Hint:* Confirm knowledge and mention which ones you use (class diagrams, sequence diagrams, flowcharts).

25. What is the difference between class diagrams and sequence diagrams?
    *Hint:* Class diagrams show static relationships (classes, attributes, methods, associations); sequence diagrams show runtime interaction and message flow between components.

26. Which tools do you use to create a TDD?
    *Hint:* List tools you’ve used—Sparx Enterprise Architect, Microsoft Visio, StarUML, or similar.

    *Hint:* Debugging is stepping through code (using breakpoints) to identify and fix bugs.

35. What is the difference between debugging and testing?
    *Hint:* Debugging is done by developers to step through and fix code; testing (by QA) systematically verifies software behavior with test cases.

36. What is “drop to frame”?
    *Hint:* In a debugger, “drop to frame” lets you move execution back to the start of the current method to re-execute it.

37. Can we change the value of a variable when the program is running?
    *Hint:* Yes—during debugging, you can hover over or use a variables pane to modify values on the fly (e.g., change `result` from 30 to 60).

38. Have you ever worked with the debug shell?
    *Hint:* Yes—while debugging, the Debug Shell allows you to run arbitrary expressions (e.g., call `string.toUpperCase()`) at runtime.

39. What is unit testing?

41. Do you know mocking?
    *Hint:* Yes—mocking creates in-memory substitutes for dependencies during unit tests, using frameworks like Mockito.

42. Explain a scenario where you used mocking.
    *Hint:* Describe testing a controller or service that depends on an unavailable API or database—create a mock of that dependency so you can unit test in isolation.

43. How will you debug an issue in your production environment?
    *Hint:* Use log files (Log4j/SLF4J), check for stack traces, and potentially pull thread or heap dumps with a profiler to pinpoint the failure.

44. What is logging?
    *Hint:* Logging is writing runtime informational messages, warnings, or errors to a file or console to track application behavior.

45. Tell me logging levels.
    *Hint:* Common levels are `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, and `FATAL`. In production, typically `INFO` or higher is enabled.

46. Which log level does your project use in production?
    *Hint:* Usually set to `INFO` or `WARN`—not `DEBUG`—for performance and to reduce log volume.

47. What are PuTTY and WinSCP?
    *Hint:* PuTTY is a free SSH client for Windows to connect to Linux servers and tail logs; WinSCP is a free SCP/SFTP client to transfer files between Windows and Linux servers.

48. Have you ever used Splunk?
    *Hint:* Yes—Splunk is a commercial tool for indexing, searching, and reporting on log data (e.g., query last 5 minutes of logs or specific time ranges).

49. Have you ever handled exceptions in your project and how?
    *Hint:* Explain Spring’s exception handling: use `@ControllerAdvice`/`@ExceptionHandler` for MVC or `@RestControllerAdvice` for REST to return user-friendly error messages.

50. What is the most complex situation you’ve faced in your current project and how did you solve it?
    *Hint:* Give a concrete example—for instance, batch jobs running slowly, corrupted data, or integration issues—and explain your troubleshooting and solution (e.g., added multithreading to improve performance).

51. Where have you used multithreading in the project?
    *Hint:* Describe a batch job that processes thousands of records—used `ExecutorService` or `CompletableFuture` to parallelize tasks and reduce runtime.

52. How are batches scheduled in your project?
    *Hint:* Mention using a commercial scheduler like OpCon or, if unavailable, alternatives like Quartz or Spring’s `@Scheduled` with cron expressions.

53. If your company didn’t have a license for OpCon Scheduler, how would you run batches?
    *Hint:* Explain using Quartz (open-source scheduler) or Spring Boot’s `@EnableScheduling` and `@Scheduled(cron = “…”)` to schedule jobs.

54. What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
    *Hint:* Authentication verifies user credentials (login); authorization checks permissions/roles (access control) once logged in.

55. Where have you used REST APIs in your project?
    *Hint:* Describe a scenario such as calling an external rules engine via REST or exposing microservices endpoints for other teams to consume.

56. How do you secure REST APIs?
    *Hint:* List methods: HTTPS/SSL, Basic Auth (not recommended for prod), OAuth2/JWT token-based, API keys, or client certificates, and mention which you use.

57. What is Swagger?
    *Hint:* Swagger (OpenAPI) generates interactive API documentation for REST services—annotate controllers so clients can see endpoints, parameters, and try them out.

58. Tell me a few annotations available in Swagger.
    *Hint:* Examples: `@Api` (on controller), `@ApiOperation` (on methods), `@ApiModel`/`@ApiModelProperty` (on models), and `@ApiResponse` for describing responses.

59. What bug-reporting tool do you use in your project?
    *Hint:* Popular tools include Jira, Bugzilla, or similar—explain how testers log defects and developers track or update them.

60. How are tasks assigned to you?
    *Hint:* Explain your process: tickets/stories created in Jira (or your tool), assigned by team lead; or tasks communicated via email or meetings, depending on your team’s workflow.

61. How many database tables are there in your project?
    *Hint:* Give a reasonable approximate number (e.g., “About 2,000 tables in this enterprise application”) and note you haven’t counted exact figures.

62. The application is taking a lot of time to respond in production—how would you identify the root cause?
    *Hint:* Investigate multiple layers: network latency, application code profiling, slow SQL queries, database performance, plus analyze thread and heap dumps with a profiler.

63. How is the build deployed to higher environments in your project?
    *Hint:* Describe your CI/CD process: developers commit to Git/SVN; the DevOps team configures Jenkins pipelines to automatically build and deploy to Dev, then SIT/UAT/Pilot/Prod once approvals pass.

64. Have you ever used Jenkins?
    *Hint:* Yes—mention you’ve created or consumed pipelines, configured jobs, and used Jenkins for automated builds, tests, and deployments.

65. What is a pipeline in Jenkins?
    *Hint:* A pipeline chains multiple build/deploy jobs in sequence or parallel. For example, deploy to Dev → QA → UAT, where each stage runs only if the previous one succeeds.

66. Who creates the pipeline in your project?
    *Hint:* Typically the DevOps (Dev/Test/Ops) team or build engineers set up and maintain Jenkins pipelines. Developers request pipelines via ticket or manager approval.

67. How do you enable email notifications in Jenkins?
    *Hint:* Configure SMTP settings under “Manage Jenkins → Configure System,” then add email steps or post-build actions (Email-ext plugin) in your pipeline or Freestyle project.

68. Which tool are you using to perform source code reviews?
    *Hint:* Mention tools like PMD or SonarQube for automated reviews, plus peer review (PRs in GitHub/GitLab) to catch coding standards, unused imports, and best-practice violations.

69. What code-coverage tool do you use in your project?
    *Hint:* JaCoCo is common—explain how you include the JaCoCo plugin in `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` to generate coverage reports for JUnit tests.

70. In your resume you mentioned Linux—tell me some Linux commands.
    *Hint:* List: `ls` (list files), `grep` (search within files), `cp` (copy), `rm` (remove), `head`/`tail` (view file start/end), `vi` or `vim` (edit files), `ps`, `top`.

71. Have you ever been involved in a KT (Knowledge Transfer) session?
    *Hint:* Yes—describe how as a new joiner you received a KT from your team and how you later delivered KT to new hires on your project.

72. Why do you want to change from your current job?
    *Hint:* Focus on positive reasons: seeking career growth, learning new technologies (cloud, DevOps), or better compensation, rather than criticizing your current employer.

73. If one of your team members isn’t completing tasks on time, how will you deal with them?
    *Hint:* Explain that you’d first mentor or help troubleshoot their roadblocks; if issues persist, you’d escalate to your lead or manager.

74. Have you ever provided a data fix for a production system?
    *Hint:* Describe a situation where bad data or a batch job corrupted records; explain how you prepared a corrective script, got approvals, and updated the database carefully.

75. How will you perform DDL changes in SIT/UAT environments?
    *Hint:* You don’t directly change the schema; you request the DBA team (via Jira ticket or email) with proper table/column details, and they apply the changes after approval.

76. Have you done any documentation for your project?
    *Hint:* Mention service documents (API specs), release notes, and user guides or onboarding docs you prepared to help new team members.

77. Where do you see yourself after 3 years?
    *Hint:* Talk about career goals: mastering a new domain, earning certifications (Java, AWS, DevOps), moving into an architect role, or leading teams.

78. What is your notice period?
    *Hint:* State the official notice period as per your contract (e.g., one, two, or three months). If asked to negotiate, offer to discuss with your manager and HR.
